<h1>Scope</h1>

This document describes the conventions used for the Glade window design files.<br>


<h1>Introduction</h1>

The following are spacing and other conventions observed in the Glade files
<code>src/products/gLiveSupport/var/glade/*.glade</code>.  They are loosely
based on the design documentation <code>styleguide.pdf</code>.


<h1>Structural conventions</h1>

<p>Each toplevel has its own file, named the same as the C++ class which
controls it, with the extension <code>.glade</code>.  For example:
<code>ScratchpadWindow.glade</code>, <code>LiveModeWindow.glade</code>.
Pop-up dialogs which do not have their own class go into the Glade file
of the toplevel which pops them up.

<p>Each toplevel should be a GtkWindow, except for pop-ups like the Login
window, confirmation dialogs etc., which are GtkDialogs or subclasses of it.</p>

<p>Always use boxes, because this assures that the widgets get positioned
and resized properly when the window is resized.  Each toplevel should
contain a single GtkVBox, which contains some number of GtkHBoxes and
GtkHButtonBoxes, which in turn contain the widgets.</p>

<p>If a group of widgets belong logically together, put them in their own
GtkHBox or GtkVBox.</p>


<h1>Naming conventions</h1>

<p>Widgets which need to be referred to from the controlling class should
have a camelCased name followed by "1", with the function of the widget first
and the kind of the widget second: e.g., <code>playButton1</code>,
<code>fileNameEntry1</code>, <code>scratchpadTreeView1</code>.  Such names
must be unique in their own Glade file.  If there is a group of
widgets with same function, they should be numbered starting with 1,
like this: <code>myGroupButton1</code>, <code>myGroupButton2</code>, 
<code>myGroupButton3</code> etc.</p>

<p><em>The reason for the "1" at the end of names, and for the unusual
1-based numbering for groups of widgets is that this is how Glade does it.
If you follow these guidelines, and copy or move part of the window using
copy-paste, the widget names will stay correct.  If a widget had a name
without a number, and you cut and then repasted it, its name would get an
extra "1" at the end.</em></p>

<p>Widgets which do not need to be referred can keep their Glade-assigned
names like <code>treeview3</code>; these do not need to be unique.</p>


<h1>Sizing conventions</h1>
<p>Each toplevel should have a border width of <strong>8 pixels</strong>.</p>

<p>Use spacing, not padding.  For example, if some widgets are packed into
<code>hbox1</code>, and we want 8 pixels between each widget, set the spacing
of <code>hbox1</code> to 8 pixels; leave the padding of the widgets at 0.
To put some space before the first and after the last widget, set the spacing
of the outer box which contains <code>hbox1</code>.
For finetuning, if spacing can not be used, you can add padding to boxes,
but not to widgets.</p>

<p>Normal spacing between widgets is <strong>8 pixels</strong>.  Spacing
between related widgets (e.g., an input field and its label) is
<strong>3 pixels</strong>.</p>


<h1>Other conventions</h1>
<p>Use stock buttons whenever possible.  This makes the application behave
much nicer with themes.</p>
