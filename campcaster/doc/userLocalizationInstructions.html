<h1>Scope</h1>
This document is written to help non-developers translate the Campcaster
software.<br>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
Campcaster has two user interfaces: a web interface, intended mainly for
radio station administrators (Campcaster Web), and a stand-alone graphical user
interface, for disk jockeys and such (Campcaster Studio).<br>

<h1>Localization of Campcaster Web</h1>
Please do the localization at
<a href="http://edge.campware.org/~localizer"><code>
http://edge.campware.org/~localizer</code></a>.
The user name is "guest", and the password is "campware".

<p>There are 3 screens of strings which need to be translated; you can select 
these from the first drop-down menu.  You can translate from any language 
to any language.  However, some languages may not contain all the strings,
so it's safest to translate from the <code>Default</code> values.  After you 
are done with a screen, don't forget to press the <code>Save</code> button 
at the bottom; otherwise your changes will be lost!</p>

<p>Your localization changes will be automatically reflected in the next 
release.  If you send an e-mail to the 
<a href="http://sympa.mdlf.org/wws/info/campcaster-dev">
developers' mailing list</a>, then we can thank you and add your name to 
the list of contributors.</p>

<h1>Localization of Campcaster Studio</h1>
<p>
<ol>
    <li>If editing an existing language: download the latest version of the
        language file ??.txt or ??_??.txt from
        <a href="http://code.campware.org/projects/campcaster/browser/trunk/campcaster/src/products/gLiveSupport/var/">this directory</a>
        (click on the file name, scroll down to the bottom, right-click on 
        Original Format and choose Save Target As or Save Link As, depending 
        on your browser);
        <p>if adding a new language: download 
        <a href="http://code.campware.org/projects/campcaster/file/trunk/campcaster/src/products/gLiveSupport/var/root.txt?format=txt">the latest version of root.txt</a>;</li>
    <li>edit the text between the "..."s;</li>
    <li>save it as a plain text file in UTF-8 encoding.
        Please do not send Word documents or files in other encodings. 
        Use a simple text editor like Notepad, GEdit or Kate.</li>
    <li>Finally, send it to the 
        <a href="http://sympa.mdlf.org/wws/info/campcaster-dev">
        developers' mailing list</a>.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Notes:
<ul>
    <li>Try to keep the length of the translated strings short: 
        it should not be much longer than the original English version.
        This is <b>very important</b> for button labels (look at the key for 
        the string; button labels end with "ButtonLabel").
    <li>The symbol <code>{0}</code> means that some variable data 
        (song title, file name, etc) goes there.  For example: 
        <code>"I could not find ''{0}''."</code> becomes 
        <code>"Ich habe ''{0}'' nicht gefunden."</code> in German.</li>
    <li>The underscore characters show hotkeys: e.g., <code>"_Open"</code> 
        means that Alt-O is a hotkey for the Open menu item. 
        These need to be unique within each group, i.e., you can't have 
        <code>"M_ove"</code> in the same menu.</li>
</ul>
