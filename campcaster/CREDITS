For Campcaster, see http://campcaster.campware.org

The original Campcaster (LiveSupport) concept was drafted by Micz Flor. It was 
fully developed by Robert Klajn, Douglas Arellanes, Ákos Maróy, and Sava Tatić. 
The user interface has been designed by Charles Truett, based on the initial work 
done by a team of his then-fellow Parsons School of Design students Turi McKinley, 
Catalin Lazia and Sangita Shah. The team was led by then-head of the school's 
Department of Digital Design Colleen Macklin, assisted by Kunal Jain.
