dnl NOTE: Run all configure related scripts from the tmp directory of the
dnl project.
dnl This is due to the fact that configure spreads a lot of trash around,
dnl like atom4te cache directories, config.* files, etc. into the directory
dnl it is being run from. We clearly don't want these in our base directory.
