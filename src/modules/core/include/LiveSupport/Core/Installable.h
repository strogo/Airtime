/**
 *  An interface for having objects that can install themselves.
 *  The concept of installation means setting up for long-term use.
 *  When something installs, it creates databases, writes configuration
 *  files, etc. It sets up the object to be run. This is not to be
 *  confused with instance initialization, e.g. when a server is started
 *  or stopped.
 *
 *  The following life cycle is expected from systems impelementing this
 *  interface:
 *
 *  <ul>
 *      <li>install</li>
 *      <li><ul>
 *          <li>start</li>
 *          <li>stop</li>
 *          <li>start</li>
 *          <li>stop</li>
 *      </ul></li>
 *      <li>uninstall</li>
 *  </ul>
 *
 *  Later more stages will be added, and load/save (externalization)
 *  facilities.
