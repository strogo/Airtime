<h1>Scope</h1>
This document describes C++ header file conventions for the
LiveSupport
project. See also the generic description of the <a
 href="fileConventions.html">file
conventions</a> in the LiveSupport
project.<br>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
C++ header files are files containing declarations of structures,
functions and classes, that may be shared among object files, by
including them with the pre-processor directive <code>#include</code>
in multiple source files. They are text
based files, thus they should adhere to the <a
 href="fileConventions.html#textConventions">generic text-based
conventions</a>.<br>
<br>
The LiveSupport project uses a strong object oriented approach. Part of
this approach is to group declarations of classes into their own files:
one header file and one source file for each class. Therefore each C++
header file contains the declaration of exactly one C++ class, although
inner types are defined in the same file.<br>
<h1>Naming</h1>
A C++ header files name reflects the class it is defining. Class names
begin with a capital letter, followed by lower case letters. In case of
a multiple word class name, the first letter of each word is
capitalized. Example class names are <code>Foo</code> and <code>FooBar</code>.<br>
<br>
As the name of the header file reflects the name of the class defined
in it, the header file will be named exactly as the class inside, with
the <code>.h</code> extension. Thus a class named <code>Foo</code> is
defined in
the header file <code>Foo.h</code>, and the class named <code>SomeOtherLongNamedClass</code>
is defined in the header file named <code>SomeOtherLongNamedClass.h</code>.<br>
<h1>Structure</h1>
C++ files are partitioned by using the following 80 column wide
partitioning comment:<br>
<pre>/* ==================================================== name of the partition */<br></pre>
Note that the comment is always 80 columns wide, independent of the
length of the text within.<br>
<br>
The file has the
following mandatory structure:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Header</li>
  <li>Include files &amp; namespaces</li>
  <li>Constants</li>
  <li>Macros</li>
  <li>Data types</li>
  <li>External data signatures</li>
  <li>Function Prototypes</li>
  <li>Footer<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Header</h2>
The header holds all information mandated by the <a
 href="fileConventions.html#header">generic guidelines</a>. It begins
with the generic header information, enclosed in 80
column wide partitioning delimiters.<br>
<br>
After this a macro definition follows, prohibiting the multiple time
inclusion of the header file. The name of the header-identity macro is
derived from the full name the file is expected to be included as. The
macro name is formed by replacing all non-alphanumeric characters from
the expected include definition with the '_' (underscore) character.
For a header file that will be included with the line:<br>
<pre><code>#include "Foo.h"</code><br></pre>
the identity macro is defined as <code>Foo_h</code>. For a header file
that is expected to be included as:<br>
<pre><code>#include "LiveSupport/Foo/Bar.h"<br></code></pre>
the identity macro is defined as <code>LiveSupport_Foo_Bar_h</code>.<br>
<br>
After the identity macro, a preprocessor check is performed to see if
the file is being processessed by a C++ compiler (and say not a C
compiler).<br>
<h3>Sample</h3>
A sample for a C++ header file header follows, where the file itself
would be expected to be included as <code>"LiveSupport/Foo/Bar.h"</code>.<br>

<h2>Include files &amp; namespace <br>
</h2>
This section contains all the include files that the header file needs
to include, plus namespace declarations. The include files are listed
in a most generic to most specific order: firts system include files,
then other LiveSupport module include files, and finnally include files
from the same module / product are listed.<br>
<br>
After the includes, namespace definitions follow. Each LiveSupport
object is contained in its own namespace inside the <code>LiveSupport</code>
namespace, thus this is a nested namespace declaration.<br>
<br>
After the namespace declarations, the namespaces used within the
include file itself are listed with <code>using namespace</code>
clauses. Note that the <code>using namespace</code> clauses are
strictly within the namespace declaration clauses, so that they only
take effect within the header file, but not afterwards.<br>
<h3>Sample</h3>
A sample include files &amp; namespaces section follows.<br>
<pre>/* =============================================== include files &amp; namespaces */<br><br>#ifdef HAVE_CONFIG_H<br>#include "configure.h"<br>#endif<br><br>#if HAVE_STDLIB_H<br>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;<br>#else<br>#error need stdlib.h<br>#endif<br><br>#include &lt;string&gt;<br><br><br>namespace LiveSupport {<br>namespace Foo {<br><br>using namespace LiveSupport::Core;<br><br></pre>
<h2>Constants</h2>
The constants section contains static constant values defined in the
header file.
Nowhere in the header file may be other static constants defined. This
section is
rarely used, as static constants&nbsp; outside classes are discurraged,<br>
<h3>Sample</h3>
A sample constants section follows.<br>
<pre>/* ================================================================ constants */<br><br>/**<br> *  The contant value of foo bar.<br> */<br>static const int fooBarConst;<br></pre>
<h2>Macros</h2>
The macros section contains any macros defined in the header file.
Nowhere in the header file may be other macros defined. This section is
rarely used, as macros are discurraged,<br>
<h3>Sample</h3>
A sample macros section follows.<br>
<pre>/* =================================================================== macros */<br><br>/**<br> *  Some very important macro.<br> */<br>#define SOME_MACRO     "some macro"<br></pre>
<h2>Data types</h2>
This section contains the data type definitions of the header file,
most notable the definition of the class this header file is named
after.<br>
<br>
The class itself and all its members (including private members) are
described by <a href="http://www.doxygen.org/">doxygen</a> comments.
The Java style of commenting is to be used.&nbsp; For the comment
describing the entire class, the <code>@author</code> and <code>@version</code>
tags are mandatory. For each member function, all parameters, the
return value and all possibly thrown exceptions are to be documented.<br>
<br>
The class lists its members in the following order:<br>
<ul>
  <li>private</li>
  <li>protected</li>
  <li>public</li>
</ul>
Within each of the above blocks, the order is the following:<br>
<ul>
  <li>static data members</li>
  <li>dynamic data members</li>
  <li>constructors</li>
  <li>destructor</li>
  <li>static functions</li>
  <li>dynamic functions</li>
</ul>
For proper indentation of the above blocks, see the example below.<br>
<h3>Sample</h3>
A sample data types section follows.<br>
<pre>/* =============================================================== data types */<br><br>/**<br> *  Hello class.<br> *  The only purpose of this class is to say hello.<br> *<br> *  @author  $Author$<br> *  @version $Revision$<br> */<br>class Hello<br>{<br>    private:<br>        /**<br>         *  Our famous hello string.<br>         */<br>        static const std::string        helloWorld;<br><br>    public:<br>        /**<br>         *  Default constructor.<br>         */<br>        Hello (void)                                    throw ()<br>        {<br>        }<br><br>        /**<br>         *  Say hello.<br>         *<br>         *  @return the string "Hello, World!"<br>         *  @exception std::exception on problems<br>         */<br>        const std::string<br>        hello (void)                        throw (std::exception)<br>        {<br>            return helloWorld;<br>        }<br>};<br><br></pre>
<h2>External data structures<br>
</h2>
The external data structures section contains any external data
definitions needed by the header file, that may be defined externally.
Nowhere in the header file may other external data definitions exist.
This section is
rarely used, as external data definitions are discouraged.<br>
<h3>Sample</h3>
A sample external data structures section follows.<br>
<pre>/* ================================================= external data structures */<br><br>/**<br> *  An externally defined data, which the linker will find.<br> */<br>extern int    fooBarInt;<br><br></pre>
<h2>Function prototypes<br>
</h2>
The function prototypes section contains any function prototypes
defined by the header file, that are not members of classes.
Nowhere in the header file may other such definitions exist.
This section is seldom used, as functions outside classes are
discouraged.<br>
<h3>Sample</h3>
A sample function prototypes section follows.<br>
<pre>/* ====================================================== function prototypes */<br><br>/**<br> *  An important foo function.<br> *<br> *  @return the result of foo.<br> */<br>int	foo(void)			throw ();<br></pre>
<h2>Footer</h2>
The footer of the header file closes the namespace brackets opened in
the include files &amp; namespaces section, and also ends the header
identity macro #ifdef section opened in the header.<br>
<h3>Sample</h3>
A sample footer section follows.<br>
<br>
<pre>} // namespace Foo<br>} // namespace LiveSupport<br><br>#endif // LiveSupport_Foo_Bar_h<br></pre>
