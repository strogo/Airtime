<h1>Scope</h1>

This document describes the installation procedures used by the components of the LiveSupport project.<br>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
Component installation is a process more tricky than it seems at first.
For example, when using a binary package manager, the component is
configured and compiled on a different system (the one creating the
binary package) than the one it will run on at the end.<br>
<br>
Installation also involves related issues like uninstallation and product
version migration, which also have to be discussed here.<br>
<br>
<h1>Installation use cases</h1>
<h2>Basic installation</h2>
The basic installation procedure is as follows.<br>
<h4>1. &nbsp;setting up the sources</h4>
Get and unpack the source tarball(s), patch them if necessary. Make sure all tools required by the build are present.<br>
<h4>2. configuring the sources</h4>
Run the <code>configure</code> script on the unpacked source tree.<br>
<br>
Assumptions:<br>
<ul>
  <li>don't assume that the directory prefixes supplied to <code>configure</code> will be the final installation directories for the component</li>
  <li>don't assume that the machine used for compilation will be the same machine the tool is used on (think binary package building)</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. compile the sources</h4>
The sources are compiled (if needed) by the invoking&nbsp;<code></code><code>make all</code>.<br>
<h4>4. install the component</h4>
Install (copy) the component, possibly into a different directory than
what was specified at step 2. This basically involves copying relevant
files from the (built) source directory tree into a target directory
tree.<br>
<h4>5. post-installation setup</h4>
Do post-installation (post-copy) setup of the component. This might involve the following:<br>
<ul>
  <li>create and customize configuration files</li>
  <li>setup &amp; configure external resources, like:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>database tables</li>
    <li>update configuration files of other tools used by this component</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
Assumptions:<br>
<ul>
  <li>don't assume that the component has been built (compiled) on the same system as the one doing post-installation setup.</li>
  <li>running this step and pre-uninstallation should be a null operation</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Basic uninstallation</h2>
The basic uninstallation procedure is the following.<br>
<h4>1. pre-uninstallation steps</h4>
Destroy any resources used by the component, with the components itself still being installed. This might involve:<br>
<ul>
  <li>destroying databases</li>
  <li>reverting configuration changes to external resources made in during post-installation setup</li>
</ul>
Assumptions:<br>
<ul>
  <li>this is the inverse of the post-installation setup procedure</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. uninstall the component</h4>
Remove the components files from the filesystem.<br>
<br>
<h2>Upgrading</h2>
TODO: detail the upgrading procedure<br>
<br>
<h1>Provisions in the build environment</h1>
For the above goals to be met, the following structure is needed for each component in the build environment:<br>
<br>
<pre>componentX<br>|-- configure<br>|-- bin<br>|   |-- autogen.sh<br>|   |-- postInstall.sh<br>|   `-- preUninstall.sh<br>`-- etc<br>    |-- acinclude.m4<br>    |-- configure.ac<br>    `-- Makefile.in<br></pre>
<h2>Considerations about specific installation steps</h2>
<h4>1. &nbsp;setting up the sources</h4>
none: this step is external to the package.<br>
<h4>2. configuring the sources</h4>
Assumptions:
<ul>
  <li>don't assume that the directory prefixes supplied to <code>configure</code> will be the final installation directories for the component</li>
  <li>don't assume that the machine used for compilation will be the same machine the tool is used on (think binary package building)</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. compile the sources</h4>
Assumptions:<br>
<ul>
  <li>No hard-coded references should be made to any resources the component depends on. For example:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>don't hard-code shared library paths that are being linked to</li>
    <li>don't hard-code PHP include paths that are referenced</li>
    <li>don't hard-code paths that were supplied to configure</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h4>4. install the component</h4>
When using package managers, this step is usually two-fold:<br>
<ul>
  <li><code>make install</code> is executed, with <code>${prefix}</code> and other variables overwritten, so that the package is installed into a temporary directory</li>
  <li>the files installed by the call to <code>make install</code> will be copied to their true target location when the package build based on them is installed on a target system</li>
</ul>
Note that there is a lot of package manager-specific magic happening
between these two steps, and that the steps usually take place on
different machines (after all the package is only build on one, while
it will be installed on a miriad of systems).<br>
<br>
Assumptions:<br>
<ul>
  <li><code>make install</code> really should just copy files, and neither do, nor assume anything more than that.</li>
  <li><code>make install</code> should also copy all files needed to perform the post-installation setup and pre-uninstall steps.</li>
</ul>
<h4>5. post-installation setup</h4>
The <code>bin/postInstall.sh</code> script should be used to perform
the post-installation setup. The script should expect all variables it
needs to be supplied by command-line arguments.<br>
<br>
Assumptions:<br>
<ul>
  <li>only files that were installed by <code>make install</code> can be used to perform the post-installation setup</li>
</ul>
<h2>Considerations about specific uninstallation steps</h2>
<h4>1. pre-uninstallation steps</h4>
The <code>bin/preUninstall.sh</code> script should be used to perform
the pre-uninstallation steps. The script should expect all variables it
needs to be supplied by command-line arguments.<br>
<br>
Assumptions:<br>
<ul>
  <li>only files that were installed by <code>make install</code> can be used to perform the pre-uninstallation step</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. uninstall the component</h4>
none: this step is external to the package<br>
